# GeekPlanet 🌌

Welcome to **GeekPlanet** — a community-driven platform where geeks can track, rate, and review their favorite anime, movies, games, and TV shows! This is my first Django project, a space where I'm bringing together everything I’ve learned about the framework so far, with plenty more planned along the way. 

**GeekPlanet** aims to be more than just a collection tracker; it’s a vibrant social hub for fans. Users can:
- Register and connect with other enthusiasts
- Keep tabs on their viewing and gaming experiences
- Write detailed reviews and give ratings
- Get personalized stats on their favorite media

This project is very much a work in progress, but I’m excited to keep building and deploying new features to make GeekPlanet a go-to platform for fans everywhere. Stay tuned for updates as I add more functionality and design tweaks!

## 🌐 Check it Out
Currently, the project is still in development, so the online deployment is yet to come. But don’t worry, I’ll have it live soon!
